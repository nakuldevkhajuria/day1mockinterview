        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Day 1: Javascript Interview Questions.</h2>
        <p>
        Question1 :  Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
        Question2 :  What is the spread operator?
        Question3 :  What are the differences between var, let and const?
        Question4 :  What is execution context
        Question5 :  What is meant by first class functions
        Question6 :  What are closures? Give an example of closure
        Question7 :  Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.
         Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()
        </p>

        Solution 1: equality vs strict equality
            they return the boolean value and the diff in both is that
            '==' only compares the values and '===' compare the type and value both.

        Solution 2:
            spread operator is use to merge any array, or object.
            and create a new array or object.
            it is used to destructure the non primitive data types.array and object.

        Solution 3:
            var shows hoisting, and let & const dont.

            Hoisting also occurs with function declarations.Hoisting can be confusing for new JavaScript 
            developers because it means that code can appear to "use" variables or functions before they are 
            declared.

            var doesnt use, temporal dead zone.
            TDZ is a place where the variable which is declared using
            let and const are been stored.
            And if the variable is not initiated then on accessing the 
            variable it will give us Reference Error.
            and in the same case with var it will return undefined.

            value of const cannot be changed but value of let and var can be changed.
            accoording to the scope change.

            var is global scoped and let and const are block scoped.

        Solution 4:
            An execution context consists of two things:

            1. A reference to the variable object (VO) that represents the current scope of the code.
            2. A reference   to the value of the this keyword, which is determined by how the code is 
            called.


            types of Execution context:
            1. global Execution context.
            2. function execution context
            3. eval execution context

            In addition to these three types of execution contexts, there is also a concept called the 
            "execution context stack," which is a stack of execution contexts that represents the order in which functions are called.


        Solution 5:
            In summary, a first-class function in JavaScript is a function that can be stored in a variable, 
            passed as an argument to a function, returned as a value from a function, and treated like any other object in the language.

        Solution 6:
        Closures are often used in JavaScript to create private variables and methods. For example, a 
        closure can be used to define an object that has a private property, and a public method that can 
        access and modify that property.
